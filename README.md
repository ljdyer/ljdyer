I am a programmer and translator with several years' experience developing applications to support translation work and a deep understanding of current issues and trends in natural language processing. I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Visual Basic for Applications and have experience working in many other programming languages.

Please see below for a small selection of some of the programming projects I have worked on recently.

# Productivity tools for translators

I have been developing a variety of applications, including productivity tools, to support translation work for several years. The majority of these projects are not featured on my GitHub as are the property of my previous and current employers, but <a href="https://github.com/ljdyer/dom2doc">dom2doc</a> is a publicly-available browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that lets you download text from the DOM elements that you specify as a Word file that is used by my current team.
