I am a programmer and translator with several years' experience developing applications to support translation work and a deep understanding of current issues and trends in natural language processing. I am proficient in Python, JavaScript, and Visual Basic for Applications and have experience working in many other programming languages.

Please see below for a small selection of some of the programming projects I have worked on in recent years.

# Fun stuff

- I am currently my posting solutions to <a href="\advent-of-code-2021">Advent of Code 2021</a> as I work on them every day up to 25th December.
- I participate in the monthly online 'Mini Hack' event and was winner of the first 6 month league.
- <a href="\learning-with-remy">Learning with Remy</a> is a web-based counting game developed as a present for my nephew Remy (aged 5 at the time) for Christmas 2020.

# NLP-related Python projects

I am currently enrolled in the <a href="https://www.wlv.ac.uk/courses/ma-computational-linguistics/">MA Computational Linguistics</a> course at the University of Wolverhampton and am developing programs to solve natural language processing problems as they are covered in the course in order to develop my skills and further my understanding.

- <a href="/pos-sequence-finder">POS sequence finder</a> is a Windows desktop app that lets you find phrases in the Brown corpus that match given part of speech sequences.

# Productivity tools for translators

I have been developing a variety of applications, including productivity tools, to support translation work for several years. The majority of these projects are not featured on my GitHub as are the property of my previous and current employers, but <a href="/dom2doc">dom2doc</a> is a publicly-available browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that lets you download text from the DOM elements that you specify as a Word file that is used by my current team.
